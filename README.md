# Power Analysis

A beginner-friendly project to explore power consumption trends in India (2019-2020).

## What This Project Is About
This project looks at how much electricity was used in different states of India over two years (2019-2020). I wanted to see how the COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020) changed power use. I used Python tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to analyze the data and make simple graphs. It’s my first step into data analysis, and I’m excited to share it!

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Power Consumption in India (2019-2020) on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/twinkle0705/state-wise-power-consumption-in-india)
- **Details**: Daily power use (in Mega Units, MU) for Indian states from January 2, 2019, to May 23, 2020.
- **File**: `power_consumption_India.csv` (included in this repo)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Pandas**: For working with the data table.
- **NumPy**: For doing math like averages.
- **Matplotlib**: For making graphs.

## How to Run This Project
1. **Get the Files**:
   - Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/power-analysis.git`
   - Or download it as a ZIP from GitHub.
2. **Open in Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Upload `power_analysis_beginner.ipynb` (File > Upload Notebook).
   - Upload `power_consumption_India.csv` (use the folder icon on the left).
3. **Run It**:
   - Click the play button on each code block, one by one.
   - You’ll see the data, graphs, and report!

## Project Files
- `power_analysis_beginner.ipynb`: The main notebook with all the code.
- `power_consumption_India.csv`: The data file from Kaggle.
- `README.md`: This file you’re reading!

## What I Learned
- How to load and clean data with Pandas.
- Basic math with NumPy (like finding averages).
- Making graphs with Matplotlib to tell a story.

## Next Steps
- Add more states to compare (like industrial vs. rural ones).
- Try fancier graphs or tools (maybe Plotly next time).
- Learn more about time-series analysis.
